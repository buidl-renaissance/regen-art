# **Decentralized Identifier (DID) System and Social Account Recovery**

To ensure secure and efficient participation in the "Make It a Home" initiative, the system will be built around Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). This framework will maintain updated records of stakeholders while enabling a robust recovery mechanism to prevent access loss.

## **Decentralized Identifier (DID) System**

The DID system provides a decentralized and user-controlled identity management solution, linking participants and their activities within the program.

### **Key Features**
1. **Stakeholder Records:**
   - Issue a DID to each participant (homeowners, inspectors, funders, contractors).
   - Link DIDs to roles, contributions, and property status.

2. **Secure Interactions:**
   - Enable verified, secure communication and transactions between stakeholders.
   - Tie ownership, approvals, tax payments, and funding to DID-verified identities.

3. **Dynamic Updates:**
   - Maintain real-time records of stakeholder participation and property improvements.

## **Social Account Recovery Program**

To address the risk of lost private keys, the platform integrates a social recovery mechanism, ensuring accessibility while promoting trust in the system.

### **Key Components**
1. **Recovery Network:**
   - Allow participants to nominate trusted individuals or local organizations as "guardians."
   - Guardians assist in restoring access if private keys are lost.

2. **Educational Events:**
   - Host workshops to educate participants on private key management and recovery processes.
   - Emphasize the role of guardianship and best practices for security.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication:**
   - Combine guardian approval with additional verification methods (e.g., identity checks tied to DIDs) for secure recovery.

## **Integration with the Broader Community**

1. **Community-Driven Governance:**
   - Tie DIDs to community participation, enabling voting rights in the DAO overseeing the initiative.
   - Transparent decision-making through verified identity management.

2. **Event-Driven Onboarding:**
   - Use local events to onboard participants, providing hands-on training for DID systems and social recovery tools.
   - Encourage community engagement with accessible and user-friendly processes.
