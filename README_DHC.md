# **Expanding Tokenization to Public Goods: Affordable Housing & Beyond**

## **Overview**
The goal is to integrate blockchain technology into Detroitâ€™s public housing initiatives, including the Detroit Housing Commission (DHC), to streamline operations, improve transparency, and make public goods more accessible. This expansion involves tokenizing housing assets and federal funding programs for efficient management.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Tokenized Affordable Housing**
- **NFT Property Ownership:**
  - Tokenize public housing properties for transparent management of ownership, repairs, and compliance.
  - **Eligible Tenants:** Tenants can be granted tokens representing their residency and ownership, potentially upgrading to full ownership through tokenized loans or grants.
- **Smart Contract Management:**
  - Automate the allocation of housing vouchers and eligibility checks.
  - Tokenize rent payments and subsidies for transparent transactions.

### **2. Managing Federal Housing Programs**
- **Tokenizing Federal Funds:**
  - Tokenize federal funds supporting local housing programs, such as low-income housing tax credits or Section 8 subsidies.
  - **Transparent Fund Allocation:** Track and ensure federal funds are distributed properly for housing projects and tenants.
- **Automated Compliance Reporting:**
  - Smart contracts can track compliance with federal regulations (tenant income, housing quality), reducing administrative burdens on the DHC.

### **3. Repair and Maintenance for Public Housing**
- **Tokenized Maintenance Funds:**
  - Create tokenized repair and maintenance funds for public housing projects, with local businesses and government contributing to a pool for repairs and upgrades.
- **Repair Requests and Approval Workflow:**
  - Tenants submit repair requests via a dApp, with smart contracts validating and approving them.
  - Municipal inspectors and contractors log repair progress on-chain to meet health and habitability standards.

### **4. Community Incentives and Engagement**
- **Local Stakeholder Engagement:**
  - Local businesses and community members can stake tokens to support affordable housing projects.
  - Token rewards for contributions to community housing initiatives.
- **DAO for Governance and Oversight:**
  - A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can oversee fund allocation, maintenance projects, and voting on priorities to ensure community-driven decisions.

### **5. Broader Public Goods Integration**
- **City-Wide Tokenization of Public Services:**
  - Extend tokenization to other city services like education, public health, and transportation.
  - Tokenized incentives to encourage participation in programs like neighborhood improvement or public safety initiatives.
- **Public Service Reward Systems:**
  - Reward citizens with tokens for contributing to public goods (e.g., volunteering, reporting issues, attending community meetings).

## **Platform for Managing Public Housing and Services**
- **Centralized Hub for Public Goods:**
  - Build a blockchain-based platform to access housing-related services: applying for housing, checking rent and tax statuses, submitting repair requests, and contributing to community funds.
- **API Integrations with Local Governments:**
  - Integrate with the Detroit Housing Commission and other departments to ensure the platform aligns with municipal systems.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Partnership with the Detroit Housing Commission:**
   - Work with DHC to pilot tokenization for affordable housing and federal funding management.
2. **Collaborate with Local Businesses:**
   - Engage businesses to contribute to a repair fund for public housing improvements.
3. **Launch a Pilot Program:**
   - Deploy a blockchain prototype for housing management, repair funding, and community engagement.
4. **Educate the Community:**
   - Host informational sessions for residents, businesses, and city officials to explain blockchain benefits and how they can participate.
